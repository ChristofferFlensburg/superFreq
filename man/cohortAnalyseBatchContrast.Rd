\description{
Analyse individuals for reccuring mutations
}
\details{
This function calculates mutation rates over genes, both protein changing SNVs, as well as CNA rates for complete loss, loss, gain (3 copies) and amplification (4 or more copies). It also track biallelic loss of genes in samples, by complete loss, a protein changing SNV plus a loss, or two SNVs (that are assumed to be on different alleles). Output is a plot over the genome of the CNA rates, as well as a "top table" of frequently mutated genes. It is run as an afterburner, and needs a finished superFreq analysis to be run on the samples.
