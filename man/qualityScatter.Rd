\arguments{
\item{q1}{data.frame. The variants of the x sample, taken from the loaded data$allVariants$variants$variants$mySample}

\item{q2}{data.frame. The variants of the y sample, taken from the loaded data$allVariants$variants$variants$mySample}

\item{ps}{numeric. p-values of the variants. Default NA calculates them, but supplying them directly can save time.}

\item{covScale}{numeric. The coverage where the point size is one. Larger coverage scale will make the points smaller. Default 100.}

\item{maxCex}{numeric. Cutoff for maximum point size. Default 1.5.}

\item{minCov}{numeric. Variants with coverage below this level are not plotted.}

\item{plotFlagged}{logical. If flagged variants shouldbe plotted. Default T.}

\item{cpus}{numeric. The maximum number of cpus to run on.}

\item{verbose}{logical. If some diagnostic outputs should be printed to terminal. Default T.}

\item{print}{logical. If gene names of significantly different VAFs should be printed on the plot. Default F.}

\item{printRedCut}{numeric. The redness (0 to 1) above which gene names are printed if print is TRUE. Default 0.99.}

\item{printOnlyNovel}{logical. Only print gene names if the VAF is small in one sample if print is TRUE. Default FALSE.}

\item{plotPosition}{logical. Show the genomic position of each variant with a thin line to the top of the plot, as well as colour coding. Default FALSE.}

\item{genome}{character. The genome aligned to. Default 'hg19'.}

\item{outputHighlighted}{logical. Prints the printed genes to terminal. Default FALSE.}

\item{legend}{logical. If the legend should be included. Default TRUE.}

\item{redCut}{numeric. Sets how significantly different the VAFs have to be fo the dot to be coloured red. Default 0.75.}

\item{forceCol}{colour. Forces all the dots to this colour. Default NA does colour by significance.}

\item{add}{logical. If TRUE, the dots are added to the existing plot. Default FALSE.}

\item{GoI}{character. vector of genes of interest that always get their gene name printed on the plot. Default c().}

\item{printCex}{numeric. A scaling factor for the size of the printed gene names. Default 1.}

\item{doPlot}{numeric. If FALSE, the plot isn't made, but p values are returned. Default TRUE.}

\item{minSomaticP}{numeric. Variants with a somaticP below this cut in both samples are excluded. Default 0 includes all points.}

\item{ignoreFlagsInOne}{character. Variants with this flag in one (but not both) sample are plotted even if plotFlagged is FALSE. Default c('Svr', 'Mv', 'Nab').}

\item{ignoreFlagsInBoth}{character. Variants with this flag are plotted even if plotFlagged is FALSE. Default c('Srr').}

\item{flagOpacity}{numeric. The opacity of the flagged variants. Default 0.4.}

\item{severityWidth}{numeric. A scaling factor for the size of the orange circle for protein altering SNVs. Default 0.5.}

\item{cosmicWidth}{numeric. A scaling factor for the size of the green circle around COSMIC census genes. Default 3.}

\item{...}{remaining arguments are passed to plot(...)}

\description{
plots a scatter of the VAF between two samples
}
\details{
This function is a wrapped for the base heatmap() function. It got nicer default colours, doesn't normalise rows or columns by deafult, and has some support for differential expression data. Also prints a colour scale at the side.
}
\examples{
#random matrix to plot, centered around 0. Plot in 'DE' colours.
mx = matrix(rt(400, df=10), nrow=100)
makeHeatmap(mx, col='DE')

#random matrix to plot, between 0 and 1. Plot in default and sunset colours.
mx = matrix(runif(400), nrow=100)
makeHeatmap(mx)
makeHeatmap(mx, col='sunset')
