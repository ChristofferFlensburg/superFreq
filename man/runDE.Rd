\arguments{
\item{bamFiles}{vector of paths to the bamfiles to be analysed}

\item{sampleNames}{vector of names of the samples associated with the bam files.}

\item{externalNormalBams}{vector of paths to the pool of normal samples.}

\item{captureRegions}{GRanges capture regions, as you get from importCaptureRegions.}

\item{Rdirectory}{The directory to save or load the output to/from.}

\item{plotDirectory}{The directory to plot results and diagnosis to.}

\item{normalRdirectory}{The directory to save or load the pool of normal counts to/from.}

\item{settings}{Settings as passed to analyse(...).}

\item{genome}{Character string of the genome, such as 'hg19', 'hg38' or 'mm10'. Defaults to 'hg19'.}

\item{cpus}{The number of parallel cpus to be used. Defaults to 1.}

\item{forceRedoFit}{Boolean, forcing the differential analysis to be redone even if saved data is
present. Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{forceRedoCount}{Boolean, forcing the counting to be redone even if saved data is
present. Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{forceRedoNormalCount}{Boolean, forcing the counting of normal samples to be redone even
if saved data is present. Defaults to FALSE.}
